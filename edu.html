        Strikingly, almost all the leaders of OBOCO TRUST NGO and our chiefs
        went through our community schools of Aboase-Obohen Methodist and
        District Authority lower and upper schools. The schools were poor in
        facilities, books and teaching materials but largely we had good teachers
        who did everything to maintain good achievements. The problems of
        economic hardships and lack of development were even worse but
        pupils studied well. In 1968 our Odzikro, Nana Ando Kofi IV and also
        our CEO, Egya Obo were among ten pupils who achieved distinction
        results/certificates on MSL exams which is a record not yet broken. <br> <br> <img class="my-images" src="vids/d1.jpg" alt="" ;><br>
        1968 group of pupils went through their initial education walking
        bare-footed, hardly had pocket money to take to school but they had
        motivation to study well for their futures.
        We live in a different world today where good education is even more
        important. The Western world has parachuted ahead in education
        particularly in technology, science and research. South Korea and India
        have surged past most African countries in educational achievements
        with investment in IT yielding massive results for these countries.<br> <br><img class="my-images" src="vids/ed2.jpg" alt="" ;><br>
        Governments play their role to provide good education but the time has
        come for our community to think about how we can improve the
        educational achievenents of our children. The birth of OBOCOTRUST
        NGO as a vehicle for development gives hope, and its Foundation for
        Education will bring focus so we can work assiduously with leaders and
        teachers of our community schools to help drive up standards. We will
        work tirelessly in search of funds, equipment, materials, books and
        volunteers to help in the task of educating our youth. <br> <br><img class="my-images" src="vids/ed4.jpg" alt="" ;><br>Our mission is to
        break through and help our children into higher education with about
        25% or more enteringing into senior high schools or technical institutions
        and 15% or more going on to study for degrees in universities each year
        by the next 10 to 15 years. This is an ambitious target but worth working
        hard for.
        I am delighted to be appointed as Director of OBOCOTRUST
        Foundation for Education, a position I accept with humility and
        determination. <br> <br><img class="my-images" src="images/education2.webp" alt="" style="left: 0%;"<br>I am a product of our community schools and have been
        engaged in teaching in the community in the past so I will dedicate
        myself to the task of bringing high educational achievements and to
        encourage further learning.<br> <br>

        MEDIUM TERM OBJECTIVE
        The nearest secondary school to our community is Aburaman at Abora
        Dunkwa and there is a senior high school at Abakrampa. There is no
        secondary school within the Abora North area so most students of this
        large area of the Abora Asebu Kwamankese District go elsewhere for
        secondary education after Aboraman’s intake has been exhausted. Our
        Odzikro, Nana Ando Kofi IV has proposed that the community and its
        neighbouring communities which share our community schools consider
        working together on his proposal to upgrade part of our community
        schools into a secondary technical institution.<br><br> Initial meetings amongst
        representatives of the communities have been positive and a Steering
        Committee has been set up to advance this proposal but without further
        progress. OBOCOTRUST Foundation for Education will seek consent
        and spearhead the efforts to bring this proposal into reality. Alternatively
        in the event that the partnering communities show disinterest,
        consideration would be given to work towards seeking funds to build a
        secondary technical school at Obohen.</p><br><br><br>
