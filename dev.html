    </b><br><br>
        The Foundation for Development is the cornerstone of everything we wish to achieve as our community needs massive development being neglected like many towns and villages in Ghana.  <br><br>The little good things around us have been achieved by our community’s own efforts and determination and have been used for decades so some are obsolete, in disrepair or out of date, dangerous to use and primitive. 
        <br><br> Our community toilets are poorly designed and built, and in the hot weather you come off sweating and smelly.  
        <img src="images/e3.jpg" style="height: 140px; width: 200px;">
            <br><br>
        
        Our community suffered for decades depending on two local ponds for water and waterborne diseases killed and maimed many.
        <video src="vids/v3.mp4" controls style="height: 120px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #cb9b51; ">Poor Water Situation</video>
        <br><br> Waterborne diseases like guinea worm prevented the youth from attending school - some for about a year and some even ended up not returning to school. Our community borehole water stations have all fallen into disrepair forcing a return to using the ponds as source of their water needs. <video src="vids/v2.mp4" controls style="height: 120px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #cb9b51; ">Poor Water Situation</video> <br><br>The memories of past suffering from waterborne diseases reinforce our determination. <br><br>

            <br><br>
        
        The natural landscape of Obohen is unique, having a mixture of small hills in four corners and flat surface. <br><br>With some imaginative planning and financial help, the landscape can be transformed to something special, but sadly there is a severe erosion problem due to poor drainage and guttering. <br><br>
        
        For a town of about 2,000 inhabitants, the youth have nowhere to gather and play, learn to interact and form good friendships and relations. <br><br> Our Development Foundation has the opportunity within our OBOCOTRUST NGO to seek help nationally and internationally to lead basic infrastructure developments in the community to make life better.
        <br><br>
        It is an honour to be appointed as the first Director of our Foundation for Development which will focus on improving the physical infrastructure of Obohen.  I grew up here and attended the local schools and like many of us, moved to live in Accra after further studies.  I am in the building industry running a small building contractor company so I have the expertise to help me to be effective and successful.  Our community is crying for help and leadership so I will commit myself to help in creating different opportunities for the current generation and generations to come.
        <br><br>
        We will seek financial support to do, among other, the following:<br>
        
        ●	Completing Day Nursery Project<br>
        ●	Repair and Mechanisation of Borehole water pumping stations<br>
        ●	Modern Public toilets/bath<br>
        ●	Gym and playgrounds for the youth<br>
        ●	Erosion<br>
        ●	Improving the Durbar Grounds: paving, canopies, lighting, seating<br>
        ●	Guttering and street pavement<br>
        ●	Community Centre<br>
        <br>
        We plead with national and international philanthropists and organisations to assist us with funding to help us in our determination to improve lives.
        <br> <br>
        Thank you.
