    <p class="groups">The youths are the future for any society.  This is true but how can we endow our youths the skills which they need as they grow to become successful adults?  <br> <br>The youths of our community have one thing appreciable; they love the community and are active in weekly communal labour cleaning around and also helping out at our Day Nursery project. However, the youths need direction, mentoring and encouragement to train in skills which will lead to employment and economic activities.
        <br> <br>
        Our community in fact has a number of expertise in carpentry, masonry and electricals having in the past embraced skills training offered at nearby Biriwa Vocational School.  <br> <br> With refined and further training of our current skilled people, they can help in the training of the youths.  We will aim to develop our youth programmes to cover the whole of the Abora, Asebu and Kwamankese District connecting with schools to assess talents and assisting and guiding the youths appropriately in areas of skill training more suited to their talents and needs.
        <br> <br>
        Youth development and training is an area where volunteering can make a difference.  We will therefore actively look for help nationally and internationally on our youth programmes and also discuss and connect our programmes to vocational and technical institutions which have similar objectives so programmes can duly be certificated as vocational qualifications.
        <br> <br>
        I am delighted to have been appointed as Director to lead OBOCOTRUST Foundation for Youth Engagement, Training & Employment which is an area of interest to me.  I commit to work hard to develop youth programmes of useful life skills including:
        <br>
        ●	Healthy living, exercise and keeping fit <br>
        ●	Developing team work <br>
        ●	Building character <br>
        ●	Building leadership skills <br>
        ●	Capacity for role in the community <br>
        ●	Developing spirit of service <br>
        ●	Modern carpentry skills <br>
        ●	Electricals and Electronics <br>
        ●	Masonry and plan reading/building <br>
        ●	Basic mechanical knowledge <br>
        ●	Painting and decorating <br>
        ●	Dress making <br>
        ●	Hairdressing/braiding <br>
        ●	Pedicure and Manicure <br>
        ●	Facial and Beauty <br>
        ●	Cooking:  traditional, salads, pizza making, pancakes, cake and food  decorating, cocktails <br>
        ●	Table service, waiting/waitressing <br>
        ●	Arts, music, drama, drumming and dance <br>
        ●	Sports. <br>
        <br>
        There is great potential for our youths but what is lacking is the resources (money) with which to plan and deliver programmes to help them to grow into adulthood with skills of life which will  also help our community to develop.  We need financial support in grants and voluntary donations - nationally and internationally to build workshops and equip them for the training of the youths.
        <br> <br>
        Thank you.
