    <p>Ghana’s economy performed well to global acclaim in the last decade or so
        but like many economies of the developing world, Ghana’s economic fortunes
        appear to have faulted considerably, buffeted by global events of the Covid-19
        pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war pushing Ghana into IMF intervention
        towards the end of 2022 for economic stabilisation. 
         <span class="more">  

            The harsh realities
            inevitably affect development programmes in Ghana and disproportionately
            impact on living standards particularly that of rural communities where
            economic activity is usually low or non-existent.<br><br>
            Abora Obohen, a small town in the Abora, Asebu and Kwamankese District of
            the Central Region of Ghana, is a rural community of peasant farmers. It has
            a resident population of about 2,000 inhabitants but with many more having
            deserted the community in search of work and better life elsewhere due to
            lack of opportunities locally. <br><br>There are two or three small petty shops.
            Smallholder peasant farming forms an almost dire economic backbone of the
            community. Despite its poor state of infrastructure and economic well-being,
            the community is vibrant, thrives on tradition and religion having about six
            chiefs and eight or nine different churches which lead spiritual advancement to
            salvation even in economic and social malaise.<br><br> So the drift of the youth to
            cities after completing their basic education at the community schools is
            unavoidable in the circumstances.<br><br> The community suffers from lack of good
            basic infrastructure, there is poor housing, the roads are dangerous to drive
            on and the community schools are ill-equipped. There is a community clinic
            which also serves neighbouring towns and villages but facilities are poor and
            substandard. The structure of the clinic building itself is crumbling down due
            to bad construction and lack of maintenance.<br><br> Bore-hole water pumping
            stations which provide clean drinking water have broken down due to lack of
            maintenance forcing the community to use local ponds as source of water
            risking a return to water-borne diseases which blighted, maimed and even
            killed many people in the community in years gone past.<br>
           <img src="images/s3.jpg" style="height: fit-content; width: fit-content;">
            <br><br>Erosion is eating up
            the beautiful natural landscape of the community due to poor drainage so
            rainfall which the community’s farming population relies on in absence of
            proper irrigation system, has now become a death trap as torrential rain pulls
            down mud-built houses and makes families homeless.<br><br> 
            These dire conditions make life difficult and with the current harsh economic
            realities of Ghana, any hope of a government intervention to make things
            better is far-fetched. Despite all the gloom, there are great attributes of
            community spirit, willingness to engage and working together to improve
            things for themselves if money for materials is made available. <br><br> For decades,
            the community has devoted each Wednesday for communal work to clean up
            the streets and around. <br><br> The youth work each Wednesday freely and
            enthusiastically. This is the spirit the founders of OBOCOTRUST and other
            leaders in the community have tapped into and channelled it in starting a self
            help project of building a Day Nursery to provide for early learning for our
            children. <br><br> The Day Nursery project is now at an advanced stage with the
            roofing having been done. This gives the community hope that collectively we
            can improve life outcomes if we think well and work together with
            determination. So far, funding for the Day Nursery project has been through
            self-fundraising voluntary donations from the community, but with low income
            levels, the project is taking far too long to complete. We need financial
            support to do more to make things better in the community. <br>We have a good
            story but need support.<br><br> 
            These are the imperatives which led to OBOCOTRUST NGO being set up as
            a voluntary non-profit and non-governmental organisation and a vehicle
            through which we can develop community cohesion and also source national
            and international charitable grants, philanthropist and voluntary donations
            from benefactors to help improve the community and its neighbouring areas.<br><br> 
            OBOCOTRUST will lead the drive for change, provide impetus for
            developments in the community which we hope will spread to its neighbouring
            towns, villages and within the District for the general good of society.<br><br> 
            Financial support, expertise engagement and advice and volunteer
            participation are what we pray for to make good things happen. God help us. <br><br>
